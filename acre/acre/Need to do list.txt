Finish returning the list of claimant names and the date and the case ID

Create new function that will follow a link (that I will have to build). Should send me to the name search page (above link)

Need to build another spider (in a seperate parsing function) to break down html on search page.

once broken down need to split html, find the case ID, then search prior (and/or future) dates for a CR case ID/s.

Once I've got the criminal case ID, create another spider (in a seperate parsing function) to break down the information on the criminal side.

combine criminal and civil information in one dict and yield it.   

scrapy runspider civil_forfeiture.py -o civil_2015.json
